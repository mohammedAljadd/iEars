# Overview

Hello everyone, this is a project I am working on with the members of my team in our engineering school [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/). The idea is to design and build smart glasses for blind people. We named our product “iEars” because the user uses his ears to sense the environment.

The three main services of our product are:
    
    - Facial recognition.
    - Object detection.
    - Text recognition and translation.

There will be two modes for using the product:

    - First mode is image processing. 
    - Second mode is real-time processing.

So, the user has the choice to choose between image processing or real-time processing for better experience.
